Here's an example of what you can put in your `start-bitcoind.sh` script to start Bitcoin Core:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Define the configuration file and data directory
CONFIG_FILE="/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf"
DATA_DIR="/var/lib/bitcoind"

# Start Bitcoin Core
/usr/local/bin/bitcoind -conf=$CONFIG_FILE -datadir=$DATA_DIR -daemon

# Check if Bitcoin Core started successfully
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Bitcoin Core started successfully."
else
  echo "Failed to start Bitcoin Core."
fi
```

### Explanation of the Script:

- **Shebang**:
  - `#!/bin/bash`: Specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.

- **Define Configuration and Data Directory**:
  - `CONFIG_FILE="/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf"`: Path to the Bitcoin Core configuration file.
  - `DATA_DIR="/var/lib/bitcoind"`: Path to the data directory where Bitcoin Core stores its data.

- **Start Bitcoin Core**:
  - `/usr/local/bin/bitcoind -conf=$CONFIG_FILE -datadir=$DATA_DIR -daemon`: Command to start Bitcoin Core as a daemon using the specified configuration file and data directory.

- **Check if Bitcoin Core Started Successfully**:
  - `if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then ... else ... fi`: Checks the exit status of the previous command (`bitcoind`). If the exit status is `0`, it means the command was successful, and the script prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints a failure message.

### Steps to Use the Script:

1. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the above content as `start-bitcoind.sh` in your `scripts` directory.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - Make the script executable by running:
     ```sh
     chmod +x scripts/start-bitcoind.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Run the script to start Bitcoin Core:
     ```sh
     ./scripts/start-bitcoind.sh
     ```

This script should help you start Bitcoin Core with the specified configuration and data directory. Let me know if you need any more assistance!
